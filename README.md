# Sagar Portfolio — Vite + React

This repo was converted from a static HTML site into a Vite + React app. The original `style.css` was preserved as requested.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\portfolio\portfolio
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The original `style.css` is used directly from the project root (`/style.css`).
- The image `Snapchat-1825751117.jpg` should be placed in the project root so it can be referenced at `/Snapchat-1825751117.jpg`.
- External libraries `ScrollReveal` and `Typed.js` are loaded via CDN in `index.html` to match the original behavior.
